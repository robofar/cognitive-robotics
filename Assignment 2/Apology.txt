Hello. I uploaded our homework now (1.11. 2pm) even though deadline was yesterday (31.10 until lecture). I want to apologize for this. We finished most of the homework many days ago (which you can see by the ipynb script, that was modified 8 days ago), but I left task 3 (EKF and UKF) to finish for some other day. Since we had some project presentation, we were focused on that, and only yesterday after that presentation, in the evening in the train to Cologne we realized that we totally forgot to upload our homework. At that time we did not have access to my laptop, so that is why I am uploading now only. I admit that I finished task 3 today (which took me 10 minutes to write), but other two tasks were finished week ago. We apologize once more, we would not like to lose points for this homework, and we hope you understand. It will not happen in future, and even if it happens, we will not upload it at all in that case. Thank you!
